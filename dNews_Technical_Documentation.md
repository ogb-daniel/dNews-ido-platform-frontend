# dNews Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the dNews platform, detailing its architecture, smart contracts, frontend implementation, testing methodologies, and deployment strategies. dNews is a decentralized media platform built on blockchain technology, designed to incentivize truth, penalize misinformation, and foster community-driven journalism. This documentation is intended for developers, auditors, and technical stakeholders interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the dNews ecosystem.

## 2. Smart Contracts

The dNews platform's core logic and economic mechanisms are governed by a suite of Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet. These contracts are designed for security, transparency, and efficient interaction within the decentralized ecosystem.

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The smart contract architecture comprises three primary contracts: `TruthToken.sol`, `IDOContract.sol`, and `VestingContract.sol`. An additional `PAUDollar.sol` contract is included for testing purposes, simulating a stablecoin for token purchases. The contracts are developed using Solidity ^0.8.19 and the Hardhat framework, leveraging OpenZeppelin libraries for secure and audited implementations [3, 4].

```
contracts/
├── TruthToken.sol       # Main ERC-20 token with advanced features
├── IDOContract.sol      # Token sale contract with multi-phase support
├── VestingContract.sol  # Token vesting for team/investors
└── PAUDollar.sol       # Mock pUSD token for testing
```

### 2.2 TRUTH Token Contract (`TruthToken.sol`)

This contract implements the ERC-20 standard for the native TRUTH token, incorporating additional features for enhanced functionality and control.

#### Core Features:

- **Name**: TRUTH Token
- **Symbol**: TRUTH
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 TRUTH (fixed supply, non-mintable to prevent inflation)
- **Burnable**: Supports token burning, contributing to deflationary mechanics [3, 4].

#### Advanced Features:

- **Vesting Mechanism**: Designed to integrate with the `VestingContract.sol` for linear vesting of team and investor allocations.
- **Transfer Restrictions**: Includes a `Pausable` mechanism (emergency use only) to halt token transfers in critical situations.
- **Governance Integration**: Supports EIP-2612 permit functionality, allowing for gas-less approvals and deeper integration with governance systems.
- **Blacklisting**: Emergency blacklist functionality for malicious actors, providing a last-resort security measure [3, 4].

#### Security Requirements:

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Implemented on all external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Access Control**: Utilizes `Ownable` and `AccessControl` patterns for managing owner and admin roles, ensuring only authorized entities can perform critical functions.
- **Emergency Pause Functionality**: The `Pausable` contract allows for pausing token transfers in case of detected vulnerabilities or emergencies.
- **Rate Limiting**: Mechanisms to limit large transfers, mitigating potential market manipulation or flash loan attacks.
- **Multi-signature Wallet Integration**: Critical functions are intended to be controlled by a multi-signature wallet for enhanced security and decentralized control [3].

### 2.3 IDO Contract (`IDOContract.sol`)

This contract manages the Initial DEX Offering (IDO) for the TRUTH token, facilitating the sale of TRUTH in exchange for ETH (or PAU Dollar in test environment).

#### Sale Configuration:

- **Sale Token**: TRUTH
- **Payment Token**: ETH (or PAU Dollar for testing)
- **Sale Duration**: Configurable (e.g., 7 days)
- **Price**: Configurable (e.g., 0.00015 ETH per TRUTH)
- **Hard Cap**: Configurable (e.g., 22.5 ETH)
- **Soft Cap**: Configurable (e.g., 7.5 ETH - minimum viable raise)
- **Individual Caps**: Configurable minimum (e.g., 0.01 ETH) and maximum (e.g., 2 ETH) contribution limits per address [3, 4].

#### Phases:

1.  **Preparation Phase**: Contract deployment and configuration.
2.  **Active Sale Phase**: Public token sale period.
3.  **Finalization Phase**: Liquidity pool creation and token distribution.
4.  **Claim Phase**: Token claiming for participants [3].

#### Core Functions (Solidity Snippets):

```solidity
// Purchase functions
function buyTokens() external payable
function buyTokensWithReferral(address referrer) external payable

// Admin functions
function startSale() external onlyOwner
function finalizeSale() external onlyOwner
function emergencyPause() external onlyOwner

// User functions
function claimTokens() external
function getContribution(address user) external view returns (uint256)
function getRemainingTokens() external view returns (uint256)
```

#### Security Features:

- **Contribution Limits**: Enforced per address to prevent whale dominance and ensure wider distribution.
- **Whitelist Functionality**: Optional feature to restrict participation to pre-approved addresses.
- **Refund Mechanism**: If the soft cap is not met, participants can claim a refund of their contributed ETH/pUSD.
- **Time-locked Token Release**: Tokens may be released to participants over a period, preventing immediate large-scale dumps.
- **Reentrancy Guards**: Applied to all state-changing functions to protect against reentrancy attacks [3].

### 2.4 Vesting Contract (`VestingContract.sol`)

This contract manages the linear release of TRUTH tokens to team members and private investors over predefined periods, often with a cliff.

#### Features:

- **Linear Vesting**: Tokens are released proportionally over a specified duration.
- **Cliff Periods**: A period during which no tokens are released, after which linear vesting begins.
- **Emergency Revoke Functionality**: Allows for the revocation of vesting schedules under specific, authorized conditions.
- **Multiple Beneficiary Support**: Capable of managing vesting schedules for multiple recipients [3].

#### Vesting Schedules (Examples):

- **Team/Founders**: 4-year linear vesting, 1-year cliff.
- **Private Investors**: 2-year linear vesting, 6-month cliff.
- **Community Rewards**: Gradual release over 5 years (managed separately or integrated) [3].

## 3. Frontend Layer

The dNews frontend application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the TRUTH token and IDO platform. It is built with modern web technologies to ensure a responsive, secure, and intuitive user experience.

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

The frontend is developed using Next.js with TypeScript, leveraging a component-based architecture for modularity and maintainability. Web3 integration is handled by Ethers.js or Wagmi, connecting the UI to the underlying smart contracts. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for a consistent and modern aesthetic [3, 4].
